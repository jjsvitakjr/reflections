How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It focused my attention on the only places that had a difference where the
    bug would be located.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can see where I can group a bunch of smaller changes to the code to form
    a much larger change.  Also, I can see where I learned a new concept or
    way of doing something that would be useful in the future.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro: Rather than having a lot of smaller changes, have a smaller number
         of larger changes.  Larger changes are better to see the progress
         than having to wade through an ocean of small changes.
    Con: You may forget to do a commit at the best possible time.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    A software system is the netire collection of files with all the files
    interdependent and changes in several files form alogic unit o change.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I use git log to see the commits made in order to find the commit with the
    change that may have the error introduced.  I use git diff to see the
    difference in my code between that commit and the previos commit.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always restore your code to the last correct version and resume
    there to fix the bug.  But, if that doesn't work you can restore back to
    the latest version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For my course on Front End Web Development as well as in teaching my
    course that utilize programming assignments where my students can learn a
    useful tool they'll need in their career.
