When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When you are collaborating with several other people and you would want them to see
    the changes right away.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may want to work with the previous version for a while to experiment but then revert
    back to that previous version.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    Fork is when you want to use a repository that you can't change by creating your own
    version of it.
    Clone is when you want to use a repository on your local machine.
    Branch is when you want to experiment with another branch of your repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    In case there have been changes to the remote repository then we can see if the local
    and remote repositories need a merge.
