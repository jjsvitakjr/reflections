When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When you are collaborating with several other people and you would want them to see
    the changes right away.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may want to work with the previous version for a while to experiment but then revert
    back to that previous version.
